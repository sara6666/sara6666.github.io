	<p>As a young art student, I am currently using my time at San Jose State to explore different mediums to use for making my pieces. I mainly make drawings using charcoal and graphite, but I also do 3D sculpting with wood and cast multiple objects out of different material such as plaster. Since this past semester I've had the opportunity to use digital media to make art. Experimenting with all of these different mediums has allowed me to create things that I didn't think would ever be possible. The drawings are simple enough in that I mainly captured still life in a majority of my work. My sculptures are considered to be representational of nature, beauty, and the creation of your own meaning for it. I used what I learned in my digital media class to make this website, which is comprised completely out of HTML and CSS code. Coding is a concept that is very new to me and was the most difficult to work with, but I feel like I was still able to create something that I'm proud of despite the multiple obstacles I faced during the process.

	As someone who experiences a lot of anxiety in my daily life, I am happy that I have been able to use my art as an outlet for my stress. To me, making art can easily be a way to turn my stress into contentedness. This doesn't even have to be restricted to drawing, painting, or sculpting; it could range from a wide variety of mediums, sources, and techniques. Without art I'm not sure how else I could be able to channel my inner workings into something more positive. I feel inspired by my own perspective on the world around me and by the people and things that matter to me the most and have personally shaped who I am. I hope to better convey this in my future pieces so that others can feel a connection to my thoughts and inspirations.
